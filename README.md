# OCVCmakeTCCFinal
An Android application for mapping a grid field with obstacles and e-puck robots for future research in mobile robotics based on path planning using cellular automata. The map is generated through image processing using OpenCV compiled with CMake. 

This project was developed as part of a dissertation work based on the requirements for the conclusion of my graduation in Mechatronics Engineering in Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.
